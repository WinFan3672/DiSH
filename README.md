# DiSH
A perfectly normal shell written in .NET.

## What Is DiSH
DiSH (Disappointing SHell) is a shell written in .NET designed for a unique class of user. It does not appeal to the average Bash soyboy and it certainly isn't a Zsh replacement. Fish users are not statistically significant enough for comparison.

## Features
* **Probability-based execution** saves system resources by dynamically ignoring unncessary commands.
* **A simple scripting language** eliminates the complexity, overhead, and bloat associated with Bash scripts.
* **Helpful help commands** do what a help command should do - list out all your commands. Shells like Bash and Fish take the wrong approach of trying to show 'useful' information, yet they always somehow manage to show the kinds of information only the developer finds useful.
* **Cross-platform** means you can run it on Windows like some kind of monster. Or you could run it on Linux.
* **Speed** ensures you aren't waiting for your init script to load in. 
* **Memory-safety** ensures your memories never leak from your hard drive and into your case.
